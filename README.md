Summary of redux-react best practices

Please raise an issue or a PR when you see anything inappropriate (with valid arguments).

## 1. setState for local UI state
Compared to storing everything in redux's `store`, letting Component to handle their own has the benefit of 
* more direct, `setState -> render -> shouldComponentUpdate` instead of `action -> store -> render -> shouldComponentUpdate` 
* more readable as you can know what happen to the state just by looking at the Component's code, without digging into the action and reducer.

an example of local UI state would be whether a `checkbox` is checked or not, `{checked: true}`

## 2. Reducer should be pure
This is being repeated in quite a lot of places, one reason being impure reducer will break the time travel functionality of redux-dev-tools, as you cannot revert side effect.

## 3. Side effects == Actions
All side effects should be in actions, actions should be the only way Component interact with outside world (store, ajax or websocket call). This will simplify the component, and provide a simpler, less buggy architecture.

## 4. Smart Component vs Dumb Component
Separate components into two categories, 
* Smart - Components that have direct access to store and actions
* Dumb - Components that have no direct access to store and actions
This allow Dumb components to be highly composable and seldom need to be change
There are a few more rules to be consider, kindly check link below.

## 5. Data conversion in ActionCreators
Actions being the bridge of your application to the outside world should in charge in reshaping data shape if necessary, for example if external api return an array `['Female', '178cm', '55kg']` , what you want to store is `{gender: 'F', height: '178', weight: '55'}`, this conversion should happen in ActionCreators.

## 6. Selectors should follow SRP
Selectors should only have 1 reason to be triggered, if selectors have more than 1 reason to be triggered, some of the computation would be meaningless, it will not affect program correctness if things are pure, but it would means unnecesary computations.

##7. Component is not a good place to place side effects
Component should not have the ability to directly trigger side effects, for example network call.
Because there's very limited way to communicate with Component from outside of Component, which is by changing props that's passed into the specific component. Instead, component should fire plain action to Redux-Saga, Saga is a much better choice as it is more flexible, eg. it can aggregate several action, or it can even access state from redux store.
